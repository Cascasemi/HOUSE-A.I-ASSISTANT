The food is prepared using strict hygiene and safety regulations, and the workers are required to wear gloves and hairnets to keep the food clean and safe for consumption. Additionally, workers are trained to keep themselves and their work area clean at all times. So, there's no need to worry about the taste of McDonald's lingering on the workers."
